<p>We’re all looking forward to getting togther in Des Moines; we want everyone to be ready! This material may be useful to you regardless of your day-zero attendance.</p>
<p>We’re going to have only a short time together in person, so we want to do all we can to help everyone get their computers set up to make it easier for us to collaborate. If you are experienced with R, git, and GitHub, and you are happy with your set-up, you need not do anything.</p>
<p>We plan to do a little bit each week until the Unconf starts.</p>
<p>Just about all of this material was compiled by our friend Jenny Bryan, in her book <a href="https://happygitwithr.com">Happy Git with R</a>. In our material, we will hit the high points, then link to the source material in case you want more background.</p>

<h2>Week of March 17</h2>
<p>This week, we focus on a couple of tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>RStudio IDE [<a href="https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html">Happy-Git ref.</a>]</li>
<li>GitHub account [<a href="https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html">Happy-Git ref.</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>With the RStudio IDE, we recommend using the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/">Preview version</a>. This way, the the buttons and tabs on your IDE will be similar to the buttons and tabs on our IDE.</p>
<p>If you want to get a head-start on next week’s activity, you can make sure that your R version is at least 3.4.0:</p>
<p>For your GitHub account:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you do not have an account already, please <a href="https://github.com/join">sign up for one</a>, and keep your login-credentials handy:</li>
<li>if you <em>do</em> already have an account, please make sure you have access to your login-credentials, i.e. you can enter them into the GitHub login page.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you might imagine, you will need your login-credentials going forward.</p>
<p>With each week’s exercise, we plan to release a screencast video where we go through the steps ourselves.</p>

<h3>Verification</h3>
<p>If you can get through these steps, you are OK for this week:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>With your (new) version of the RStudio IDE, open the Terminal pane, type the command <code>date</code>, then enter. Your computer should return the current date and time.</p></li>
<li><p>Having signed into GitHub, go to <a href="">this issue</a> on our Unconf issues page, either to introduce yourself, or to add an emoji reaction. Once you have done this, you are very welcome (in fact, encouraged) to participate in some of the <a href="https://github.com/uncoast-unconf/uu-2019/issues">other issue discussions</a>, or even start new ones.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any problems, you can raise it as a new <a href="https://github.com/uncoast-unconf/uu-2019/issues">GitHub issue</a>, or email Ian Lyttle at ian [dot] lyttle [at] se [dot] com.</p>
